**Sherlock AI** - Deepfake Detection System
Sherlock AI is a machine learning-powered application designed to detect synthetic media, also known as deepfakes, in video and image content. With the rapid growth of AI-generated media, deepfakes have become an emerging challenge, posing risks to information integrity, security, and privacy. Sherlock AI provides a reliable, user-friendly solution for identifying deepfake content, contributing to safer digital spaces.

Installation
To set up and run Sherlock AI locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sherlock-AI.git
cd Sherlock-AI
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Use the following command to install necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Pretrained Models:

Download the pretrained models and save them in the models/ directory. (Instructions for downloading or a link to the models should be provided here.)

Run the Application:

Start the application server by running:

bash
Copy code
python src/main.py
Access the Web Interface:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to use the Sherlock AI interface.

Usage
Upload Media: Use the web UI to upload images or videos.
Analyze: Click the "Analyze" button to begin deepfake detection. The system will process the media and provide feedback on whether it’s likely to be authentic or AI-generated.
Review Results: View confidence scores and analysis details to evaluate the authenticity of the media content.
For an online demo, visit the project website: Sherlock AI.

Model Details
Sherlock AI employs machine learning models trained specifically to identify subtle inconsistencies and artifacts often found in deepfake media. It combines techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and spatiotemporal analysis for accurate detection across various formats.

Technologies Used
Python: Core language for backend processing.
Machine Learning: Models trained using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for a responsive web interface.
Backend: Flask for server-side operations.
Database: (Optional) For storing results or user information, add MongoDB or PostgreSQL integration as needed.
